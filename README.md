# CurioTool
A GUI that teaches/shows many random skills/facts that might be useful

To-do:
- Make a logo for the app?
- What buttons on main screen
- What screens after that
- Use the internet and how (API)
- Add files such as mp4 (stored locally or through API too?)

Change of plan:
Two apps, one for weather and time, another for mp4 videos and learning
