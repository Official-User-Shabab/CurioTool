# Pages

## Main Screen (Layer 1):

Title and logo at the top
Buttons include: Weather, [Need something, maybe time?], Learn/Skill

## Weather (Layer 2):

A dropdown menu at the top to select location
Below shows temperature in celcius, fahrenheit, and kelvin
Back button at the bottom

Will require use of the internet (API keys)
Hence shows appropriate message if unable/not connect to the internet

## Learn/Skills (Layer 2):

"Learn a random skill or hobby!" at the top
Many buttons (hence able to scroll down) that open/show mp4 file on that skill (and has title to summarise that skill)
Back button at the bottom

No need for internet, all files in this section are just stored locally (<- will take up space with more videos, maybe transfer to internet later?)

## Comments

Extremely basic so far. Second button needs to be decided upon. Need to design a logo too.
