## Main Screen (Layer 1):

Title and logo at the top
Buttons include: Weather, [Need something, maybe time?], Learn/Skill

## Button 1 Weather (Layer 2):

A dropdown menu at the top to select location
Below shows temperature in celcius, fahrenheit, and kelvin
Back button at the bottom

Will require use of the internet (API keys)
Hence shows appropriate message if unable/not connect to the internet

## Button 2 (Layer 2):

Some ideas for what this button could be:
- A world clock; times in different countries (many phones do this anyway)
- Calculator (phones do it too)
- Unit converter (Converts between different units, and also imperial and metric)
- To-do list and Task manager?
- Weekly motivational quotes?
- A mini-game, like minesweeper or chess perhaps?
- Live currency converter
- Recipe and meal ideas and lists <-- I like this one
- Weekly/Monthly riddles?
- Book recommendations lists
- Sustainability tips

## Button 3 Learn/Skills (Layer 2):

"Learn a random skill or fact!" at the top
Many buttons (hence able to scroll down) that open/show mp4 file on that skill (and has title to summarise that skill)
Back button at the bottom

No need for internet, all files in this section are just stored locally (<- will take up space with more videos, maybe transfer to internet later?)

List of videos (Need to make them, or possibly take from others? - Employ/Include others to make a video for the project?):
- [ ] How do chess pieces move on a board
- [ ] Lattice multiplication
- [ ] 

## Comments

Extremely basic so far. Second button needs to be decided upon. Need to design a logo too.
